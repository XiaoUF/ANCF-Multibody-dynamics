# ANCF-Multibody-dynamics
Multibody dynamics model for flexible vegetation
The model sets up a patch of flexible vegetation canopy consisted of uniformaly spaced flexible cantilever beams.
The Absolute Nodal Coordinate Formulation is used as the structure solver for the beams.
The OBB method is implemented to detect collisions among beams, and DEM is used as collision response.
